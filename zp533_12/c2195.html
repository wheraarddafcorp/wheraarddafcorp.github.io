The collection opens with Michael Haydn"s symphonies. By the age of 25  he already held the prestigious position of court composer and Konzertmeister in Salzburg. The earliest symphonies included here  No.1 in C and No.1B in F  date from 1758 and display the youthful energy of a composer finding his feet. In comparison  the later symphonies demonstrate a greater understanding of the complexities of every instrument in the ensemble. His penultimate symphony  F major MH507  features an expressive Adagio ma non troppo where the composer gives the bassoon a lyrical melody line. Haydn also wrote concertos that gave prominence to under-represented instruments including the trombone and the clarinet  the latter of which had only been invented at the turn of the 18th century. Haydn"s varied and extensive output caught the eye of Mozart  20 years his junior. He greatly admired Haydn and the two remained close friends until Haydn"s death in 1806. Michael Haydn has suffered from musical misattributions  and many of the works in this set have only recently been correctly attributed. For example the G major symphony MH334 was believed to have been Mozart"s Symphony No.37 until 1907  when musicologist Lothar Perger discovered Mozart had only written the introduction. Scholarship has continued shedding light on Michael Haydn"s music  and an improvement on Perger"s 1907 catalogue of the composer"s works is the recent one created by Charles Sherman and T. Donley Thomas in 1993  in which 838 pieces are each assigned an MH number according to the authors" best guesses at chronology. Michael Haydn also wrote serenades  divertimenti and notturni  genres popular during the Classical and Romantic eras  where a tuneful melody is prioritised over technical virtuosity. The D major Serenade MH86 has ten movements including a concertino for horn and trombone  which features uplifting solo lines.<br/><br/><img src="https://item-shopping.c.yimg.jp/i/n/plaza-unli_3ymd606418b24_i_20230716003828" /><br/><img src="https://item-shopping.c.yimg.jp/i/n/plaza-unli_3ymd606418b24_1_d_20230716003822" />
